# Universal representation learning for faster RL
## Alex Nam and Alex Loia (CS 230 Fall 2021 Project)
The `sample_gym_env_v3.ipynb` notebook includes our current implementation of the [CURL](https://github.com/MishaLaskin/curl) architecture (namely, the image encoder) along with our own data augmentations.

The `sample_gym_env_pretrained.ipynb` uses the same RL architecture as above but uses a pretrained ImageNet model as the image encoder, which is used to contrast against the CURL encoder.
